## Project Overview

This project is a personal Excel-based Nutrition Tracking System built to track daily food intake, calories, body weight, and weekly trends.
The focus is on automation, consistency tracking, and progress analysis, rather than manual logging.

The system updates automatically as new data is entered and is designed to handle missing or incomplete entries without breaking calculations.

## Motivation

I built this project to practice applying data analysis thinking to a real-world, everyday problem.

Instead of using a ready-made app, I chose Excel to:

- Design my own data structure

- Automate weekly summaries

- Build logic that scales over time

- Improve accuracy and consistency in tracking

This project reflects how I approach problems: define the goal, structure the data, then automate insights.

## Data Tracked

- Daily food intake

- Estimated daily calorie consumption

- Daily body weight

- Weekly average calories

- Consistency score based on daily entries

- Visual progress trends using charts

All summaries update dynamically based on user input.

## Excel Techniques Used

- Logical formulas with empty-cell handling

- Weekly aggregation using averages

- Automated calculations with no manual recalculation

- Structured data layout (inputs vs outputs)

- Data-driven charts for progress and consistency tracking

The system is designed to remain stable even when data is missing or partially entered.

## Key Learnings

- Designing Excel systems for long-term use, not one-time analysis

- Handling incomplete data without distorting results

- Translating personal goals into measurable metrics

- Thinking in terms of workflows instead of isolated formulas

This project strengthened my ability to build maintainable analytical tools, not just spreadsheets.

## Limitations & Next Steps

- Calorie values are manually entered

- No external data sources or database integration

- Future improvements could include:
  - SQL-based data storage
  - More advanced trend and variance analysis
  - Further automation beyond Excel
## Tools

Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365)
